# MiDaS: Representative Sampling from Real-world Hypergraphs

<img src="correction/correction.jpg" width="700"/>

We provide source code for (1) various approaches of sampling hypergraphs, (2) evaluating the quality of the sampling result, and (3) plotting all figures

## Datasets

In the papaer, we used datasets after removing duplicated hyperedges. We preprocessed thirteen datasets collected We preprocessed datasets collected by [Austin R. Benson][https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~arb/]. The datasets used in the paper are available in the "dataset" folder.
